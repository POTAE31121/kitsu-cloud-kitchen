# 🍽️ Kitsu Cloud Kitchen

Kitsu Cloud Kitchen is a full-stack web application designed for small restaurants,  
built from real-life experience rather than theory.

This project was inspired by a family-run seafood restaurant that struggled with
manual order handling, communication issues, and lack of backend systems.

Instead of building a complex platform,  
this project focuses on **simplicity, usability, and real operational needs**.
